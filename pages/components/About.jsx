            Hello! My name is Randi. I began my interest in Computer Science, when I was 16 and placed into a computer science by accident and loved it. Since then I've used the knowledge to create unique and interesting programs in all different kinds of languages.

            During my time at USC, I've had the privilege of working on my schools Experiential Learning Website to develop a platform that focuses on finding new ways of teaching students. Also I had the opportunity to work at a startup where I developed a hobby based social media app from the ground up. Today I work at Hymes,Barrera and Kim where I use my knowledge of Computer Science to make real-world applications that help people in their day to day life
